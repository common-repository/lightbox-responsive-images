Simple but efficient lightbox designed for Responsive Images and WP 4.4+.

== Description ==

Simple but efficient lightbox designed for Responsive Images and WP 4.4+. The image actually loaded by the lightbox will depend on your device and screen resolution.

The plugin is very simple for now (and might be enough for most users). More themes/skins will be added over time for the lightbox but this plugin will never be bloated with thousands of options.

The plugin also works perfectly with WP Retina 2x to make sure everything is perfectly neat and optimized.

PS: It does NOT work versions of WordPress prior to 4.4.

Languages: English.
